2. 

## XML Validation

XML file can be validated by 2 ways:

- against DTD
- against XSD

DTD (Document Type Definition) and XSD (XML Schema Definition) are used to define XML structure.

### XML DTD

In our XML tutorial, you will learn about DTD file, creating xml with DTD, using CSS file, CDATA vs PCDATA and difference between DTD and XML schema.

Let's see an example of XML using DTD file.

*employee.xml*

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<!DOCTYPE employee SYSTEM "employee.dtd">  
<employee>  
  <firstname>vimal</firstname>  
  <lastname>jaiswal</lastname>  
  <email>vimal@javatpoint.com</email>  
</employee>   
```
### XML Schema

In this XML tutorial, we will provide a detail description of schema file, XML schema validation, XML schema data types and XML parsers.

Let's see an example of XML using XSD file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>  
<employee  
xmlns="http://www.javatpoint.com"  
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.javatpoint.com employee.xsd">  
  <firstname>vimal</firstname>  
  <lastname>jaiswal</lastname>  
  <email>vimal@javatpoint.com</email>  
</employee>  
```
